Description: Total Variation Denoising is a regularized denoising method which
    effectively removes noise from piecewise constant signals whilst preserving
    edges.  This package contains a C++ implementation of Condat's very fast 1D
    squared error loss TVD algorithm.  Additional methods and loss functions may
    be added in future versions.
